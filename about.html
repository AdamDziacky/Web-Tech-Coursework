            <p>
                I am a second year B.Eng Cybersecurity & Forensics international student from Slovakia who came here in order to get proper good quality education.
                Cybersecurity studying programs are still not very common in the Europe, so I ended up here in Edinburgh, living with my girlfriend. I love the city, the flat is amazing and once I get rid of
                that anoying flatmate, it will be the dream come true. 
            </p>

                I have several hobbies including leatherwork, knifemaking, reading etc. By being brought up in the small village I am used to working manually, so I joined community called The Edinburgh Forge.
                They provide the access to variety of tools and materials for any person who wants to join. They are amazing folks, you should try it sometimes. Apart from that I am also trying to run a business
                remotely. I am organizing raffles / competitions for videogame players in Slovakia. If you want to check it out - here is the address: www.gamingworld.sk

                As you have probably figured out, I am also quite a fan of movies. I don't get to pick the movie because of circumstances mentioned earlier but I love good old classics and sci-fi as well. 
                I really like the movies with thematics of organized crime - Mafia. So there's no surprise that the first question of the quiz was about my all time favourite movie - The Godfather. 
                A lot of good movies out there - whether it is just for relaxation or you are looking for some answers / ideas - picking a good movie can be very helpful. That's why it's also important
                to surround yourself with people who have a good taste in movies / music.
