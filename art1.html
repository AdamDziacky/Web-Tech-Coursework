            <p>Enough about Star Wars fanboys. The Jedi Council is adjourned until there’s something new to bitch about. I’m here to talk about a rarer specimen: the Jurassic Park fanboy. We — yup, we — are out there. We have a tender-verging-on-deranged love for Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur epic, which is just out on Blu-ray. Consider the following:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Exhibit A: A midnight screening of Jurassic Park in New York City this summer. The seats are filled. Just as the movie begins, a drunken, amorous couple barges in and starts screwing around. The guy, judging from his insipid giggles, is sitting on the woman’s lap. A Jurassic fanboy’s voice fills the theater. He — and here I’m picturing an early thirties hipster in a T-shirt about as ironic as my own — sounds pissed. He threatens to throw these idiots out of the movie and back into The Tree of Life.            
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Exhibit B: Are you a “Single Interested in Michael Crichton?” Meet the love raptors stalking OkCupid.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Exhibit C: Ariana Richards played Lex Murphy — the blond girl in the purple baseball cap — in the 1993 movie. When she goes out these days, she often sees a young man gaping at her in the same way Sam Neill once gaped at a Brachiosaurus. “I’ve come to know the signs well,” Richards tells me. Jurassic Park, incidentally, was filmed when she was 12.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I could go on. Suffice it to say, it’s time to back into Jurassic Park. Hold on to your butts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When was Jurassic Park hatched? We could start in 1924, when the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote about an “alert, swift-moving carnivorous dinosaur” — Velociraptor mongoliensis. We could start in 1970, when Steven, a young movie director, and Michael, a young novelist, had a chance meeting on the lot at Universal Studios. But I’m thinking we should probably start in 1983.
